Question 115: Use a switch statement to log the days of the week based on a number (1-7).

Explain & TIP: A switch statement is a great way to select one of many code blocks to be executed. It's particularly useful for scenarios like mapping numbers to days of the week.


Question 116: Create a switch case that matches several cases to the same code block, representing seasons.

Explain & TIP: You can group multiple case statements together when they should execute the same block of code, which is handy for categorizing items into broader groups.


Question 117: Implement a switch statement that evaluates an expression and uses the default case if none of the cases match.

Explain & TIP: The default case in a switch statement provides a way to execute a block of code when none of the other case labels match the expression's value.
