Question 85: Finding the Position of a Substring: Write a function that locates the first occurrence of the word "code" within any given string and returns its position.

Explain & TIP: Use .indexOf() to find where a certain piece of text starts within a larger string. If the text isn't found, this method returns -1.


Question 86: Checking for Text Presence: Create a function that checks if the word "JavaScript" is present in a given string. It should return true if found, otherwise false.

Explain & TIP: The .includes() method lets you check if a string contains a certain piece of text, returning a boolean (true or false).


Question 87: Extracting a Substring: Demonstrate how to extract the first 10 characters from a string.

Explain & TIP: .substring() can be used to get a specific part of a string, by specifying the start and end positions.
