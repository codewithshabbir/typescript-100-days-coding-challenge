Question 79: Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing a car with properties for make, model, and year. Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.

Explain & TIP: Objects are collections of properties, kind of like a box for storing related information. You can create an object to group related data and access its properties using either dot notation or bracket notation.


Question 80: Updating Object Properties: Add a property named color to the existing car object, and then update the year property to 2021. Show how to perform these operations.

Explain & TIP: You can add new properties to an object or change existing ones after the object is created. This flexibility allows objects to be dynamically updated as needed.


Question 81: Iterating Over Object Properties: Write a function that takes an object as an argument and logs all of its properties and values.

Explain & TIP: You can loop through each property of an object using a for...in loop. This is useful for when you need to examine or display all the information an object holds.
