Question 97: Write a function that returns the current date in the format "DD-MM-YYYY".

Explain & TIP: Working with dates in JavaScript often requires formatting them in a specific way. The Date object provides methods to get the day, month, and year, which you can then assemble into any format you need.


Question 98: Create a JavaScript snippet that calculates and logs how many days are left until New Year.

Explain & TIP: To find the difference between two dates, you can subtract one Date object from another, which gives you the difference in milliseconds. Convert that to days to see how many days are left until a specific event.


Question 99: Generate a date object representing your next birthday and log it to the console.

Explain & TIP: When creating a Date object for a future event like a birthday, you might need to adjust the year based on whether the birthday has already occurred this year or not.
