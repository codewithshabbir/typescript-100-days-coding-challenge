Question 67: Arithmetic with Mixed Types: Write a function that takes two parameters: a number and a string that represents a number (e.g., "5"). Return their sum as a number. 

Explain & TIP: JavaScript allows arithmetic operations between mixed types. When you add a number to a string that looks like a number, JavaScript converts the string to a number for the operation.

Question 68: Multiplying Decimals: Create a function that accepts two decimal numbers and returns their product. Round the result to two decimal places.

Explain & TIP: When working with decimals in JavaScript, results can be unexpectedly long. Rounding can help keep numbers manageable.

Question 69: Dividing and Finding the Remainder: Write a function that divides two numbers and returns both the quotient and the remainder. Use an object to return both values.

Explain & TIP: Division can give you a whole part (quotient) and a leftover part (remainder). Returning both in an object is a neat way to keep them together.
