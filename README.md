# TypeScript 100 Days Coding Challenge

Welcome to the TypeScript 100 Days Coding Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you improve your TypeScript skills over the course of 100 days. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn TypeScript or an experienced developer aiming to enhance your proficiency, this challenge is for you.

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for the TypeScript 100 Days Coding Challenge. Each day, you'll find a new coding task or project to work on. These tasks are designed to cover various concepts and features of TypeScript, gradually increasing in complexity as you progress through the challenge.

## Getting Started
To participate in the challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Fork this repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page to create your own copy of the repository.

3. **Install dependencies**: If any dependencies are required for a specific project, they will be mentioned in the project's README file.

4. **Start coding**: Each day, navigate to the corresponding directory (e.g., `day-01`, `day-02`, etc.) and complete the coding task or project outlined in the README file.

5. **Commit your code**: After completing each task, commit your changes to your local repository.

6. **Push changes**: Push your commits to your forked repository on GitHub:
"git push origin main" 

7. **Repeat**: Continue this process for the next 100 days, challenging yourself to learn and improve every day.
