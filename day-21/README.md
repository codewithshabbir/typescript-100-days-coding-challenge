Question 61: Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

Explain & TIP: Enums are like special lists in your code that help you categorize things. They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.


Question 62: Making a Student Template: Create a blueprint for student information, including their name, age, and the classes they're taking, and then fill in this blueprint with an example student.

Explain & TIP: This blueprint, called an interface, helps ensure all students have the same kind of information, making your code more organized.


Question 63: Shape Shifter: Write a program that can describe either a circle or a rectangle using a special type alias, including properties unique to each shape.

Explain & TIP: A type alias lets you create a custom type. It's like a shortcut for describing more complex information, such as the details of different shapes.
