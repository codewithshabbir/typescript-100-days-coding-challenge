Question 106: Determine if a given year is a leap year using comparison operators.

Explain & TIP: A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400. This rule helps align our calendar years with the Earth's orbital period.


Question 107: Write a condition using logical operators that checks if a number is divisible by both 2 and 3.

Explain & TIP: Checking for divisibility involves using the modulo operator (%) to see if there's any remainder. A number divisible by both 2 and 3 without a remainder is also divisible by 6.


Question 108: Compare two strings to check if they are identical, ignoring case sensitivity.

Explain & TIP: To compare strings without considering their case (uppercase/lowercase), you can convert both strings to the same case before comparing.
