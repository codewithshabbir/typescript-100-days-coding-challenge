Question 112: Create a Map that stores the names of countries as keys and their capitals as values. Add three countries to the Map.

Explain & TIP: The Map object in JavaScript holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. It can be more efficient for large sets of data and when the key is not a string.


Question 113: Write a function that checks if a Map contains a key for "Canada" and logs the capital if it exists.

Explain & TIP: You can check for the presence of a key in a Map with the .has() method and retrieve its value with the .get() method.


Question 114: Iterate over a Map of student IDs and names, and log each pair to the console.

Explain & TIP: Iterating over a Map can be done using the .forEach() method or a for...of loop, providing access to each key-value pair.
