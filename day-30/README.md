Question 88: Rounding to the Nearest Integer: Write a function that takes a decimal number as input and returns the number rounded to the nearest integer.

Explain & TIP: The Math.round() function is perfect for rounding decimals to the closest whole number. It looks at the decimal part and decides whether to round up or down.


Question 89: Converting Strings to Numbers: Create a function that takes a string representing a number (like "123") and converts it into an actual number type.

Explain & TIP: parseInt() for whole numbers or parseFloat() for decimals are handy for turning number-like strings into real numbers, allowing you to perform mathematical operations on them.


Question 90: Checking if a Value is NaN: Demonstrate how to check if a variable's value is NaN (Not a Number) and return a boolean result.

Explain & TIP: isNaN() helps you figure out if something that's supposed to be a number didn't turn out to be a number. It's useful for validating inputs or results of calculations.
