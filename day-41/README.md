Question 121: Implement a for loop that counts from 1 to 10 but skips number 5 using the continue statement.

Explain & TIP: The continue statement can be used to skip over an iteration in a loop. It's particularly handy when you want to ignore specific cases without stopping the entire loop.


Question 122: Use a while loop to count down from 10 to 1 and breaks the loop when it reaches 5.

Explain & TIP: The break statement terminates the loop immediately. This is useful for stopping a loop when a certain condition is met, even if the loop's original termination condition hasn't been reached yet.


Question 123: Create a loop that iterates through a string and stops when it finds the first vowel.

Explain & TIP: To find a specific character in a string, you can iterate through each character and use a condition to check for vowels. The loop can stop once a vowel is found.
