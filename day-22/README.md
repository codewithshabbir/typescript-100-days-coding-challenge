Question 64: Combine Strings and Numbers: Write a function that merges a piece of text with a number. For example, if provided with "Age: " and 30, it should give back "Age: 30".

Explain & TIP: In JavaScript, the + operator can add numbers together or join strings. Mixing a string with a number changes the number into a string for the joining.

Question 65: Determine the Remainder: Make a function that gets two numbers and shows the leftover from dividing them using the % sign. For example, remainder(5, 2) should give 1.

Explain & TIP: The % (modulus) operator finds what's left after one number is divided by another. It's handy for figuring out if numbers are even, odd, and more.

Question 66: Logical AND Verification: Create a function that checks two boolean (true or false) values. It should only say true if both are true, using the && operator. For instance, checkBothTrue(true, false) should be false.

Explain & TIP: The && operator in JavaScript checks if both sides are true. It's great for confirming several things are true all at once.
